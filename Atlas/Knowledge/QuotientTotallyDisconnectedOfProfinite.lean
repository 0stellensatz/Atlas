# total disconnectedness of profinite quotients

A closed normal quotient of a compact totally disconnected topological
group is totally disconnected: any two distinct classes are separated by a
clopen set, built from an open normal subgroup avoiding a representative of
their difference, so the quotient is totally separated (#104).

## Main statements

* `quotient_totallyDisconnected_of_profinite` — the quotient of a profinite
  group by a closed normal subgroup is totally disconnected; proved.

## Implementation notes

The source's Hausdorff hypothesis is unused — the clopen separation runs on
compactness and total disconnectedness alone — and is dropped, so the
statement asks less than profiniteness while keeping the name its consumers
think under.
